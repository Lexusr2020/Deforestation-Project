# Deforestation-Project Using SQL

I have successfully extracted insights and provided a comprehensive overview of global deforestation trends spanning the years 1990 to 2016.

I created a comprehensive report that presented these findings in a clear and concise manner using SQL queries. This report served as a valuable resource, empowering the leadership team to make informed decisions, strategize initiatives, allocate resources effectively, and maximize the organization's impact in addressing the critical issue of deforestation.
